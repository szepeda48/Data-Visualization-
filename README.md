# Ford GoBike System Data

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 183412 people who use the ford GoBikes in the month of Februaury. Specifically from 2019-02-01 to 2019-2-28. 


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between wether a person is a Customer and Whether that perosn is a Subscirber. Subscribers tend to be more consistent with their rides and ride mostly during the weekdays. Customers tend to take longer rides and mostly ride bikes on the weekend. The company can also be confident that we are being confiednt in satisfying the need for recreations and commuter use because both the subscribers and customers have similar start locations, yet they have different routes they often take. It is also good to note that women tend to ride for longer perionds of time during the month of Feburary. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

The key thing that should be taken away from this is that the motivations of Custmers and subscribers are very different yet the company does an effeicient job of satisfying both their needs.
